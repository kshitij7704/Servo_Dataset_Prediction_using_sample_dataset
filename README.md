# 🤖 Servo Dataset Prediction using Sample Dataset
This project analyzes a sample servo dataset to predict the **class of a mechanical component** based on multiple input features. A **Linear Regression model** is used for prediction, implemented using popular Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.

---

## 📌 Objective
To demonstrate how machine learning (specifically linear regression) can be used to predict component classifications in servo systems using a small sample dataset.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📊 Pandas – for data manipulation  
- 🔢 NumPy – for numerical operations  
- 📈 Scikit-learn – for building and evaluating the regression model  
- 📉 Matplotlib / Seaborn *(optional)* – for data visualization (if included)
