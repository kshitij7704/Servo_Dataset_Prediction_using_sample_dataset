# ðŸ¤– Servo Dataset Prediction using Sample Dataset

This project analyzes a sample servo dataset to predict the **class of a mechanical component** based on multiple input features. A **Linear Regression model** is used for prediction, implemented using popular Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.
